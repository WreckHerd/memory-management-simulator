___Configuration must follow the following requirements___
- 0 < L1 size < L2 size < main memory size
- Buddy allocation requires memory size to be a power of two
- Line size must be a power of 2
- Cache size and main memory size must be multiple of line size
- Number of lines = L(1,2) size/linesize, must be divisible by associativity
- Associativity > 0
Note: if you want a quick run you can find test inputs in tests directory

Initialize MemoryAllocator and Cache
Do you want buddy allocation (N/y): Enter MainMemory size (bytes): Enter L1 Cache Size (bytes): Enter L2 Cache Size (bytes): Enter linesize (bytes): Enter Cache associativity ((1)direct associative / (2)-way associative / (4)-way associative / (8)-way associative): Enter Cache Replacement Policy (fifo / lru):

---List of commands---
malloc <size>     : allaocate a block of <size> in memory
free <blockId>    : free the block with id <blockId
memdump           : print the current state of memeory

read <address>    : read data a <address> from cache or memory
write <address>   : write into <address>
stats             : print stats related to cache and memory
quit / exit       : exit the simulator

 MEMSIM> allocated a block at address: 0, of size: 128, with blockId: 1

 MEMSIM> allocated a block at address: 512, of size: 512, with blockId: 2

 MEMSIM> allocated a block at address: 128, of size: 128, with blockId: 3

 MEMSIM> Freed block with id: 1, of size:128
